These UIs are used throughout the demos, changing them will affect all demo scenes. If you want to modify them try to duplicate them before making any changes.

The only difference between LevelUI and LevelUISingleLevel, is that in the single level version I have hidden the main menu and next level buttons and the high score text. 
Those buttons and text only work when you build a game with a main menu, such as the SpaceHeroMainMenu demo where you have the proper main menu index and start/end levels in the build settings and the game manager.
