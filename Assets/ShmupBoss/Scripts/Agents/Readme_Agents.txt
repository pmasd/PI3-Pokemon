The Agent folder contains anything which can be thought of as a player, an enemy or even closely related to those while not specificially inherting from the agent class.

In addition to the player and enemy classes, this folder includes the pickup class and the boss class. 

The boss class does not inherit from the enemy or agent classes but contains within it an enemy derived class as a boss sub phase.
