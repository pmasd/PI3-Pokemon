    // Note: The reason for breaking my enumerator convention of including each enumerator in a different
    // file in this instance is because the player and enemy events are actually agent events which are translated. 
    // The player and enemy events are merely a reduced form of the agent event so that it is more 
    // convenient for the user to see only the events which are related to the agent he/she are using. 
    // These events are closely associated with the AgentEventTranslator.cs script. Any modifications here
    // needs to be done as well in the AgentEventTranslator.cs script or you will get translation errors.

    /// <summary>
    /// <para>Names of events which are initiated by all the different agents (Player, Enemy, Mines, missiles, etc..).
    /// These are never selected directly by the user and are instead translated from their respective
    /// Player or Enemy event names. This approach has been taken to enable the ease of use of a unified
    /// agent driven events and to make the user only select events which are relavent to the type of agent
    /// he/she are using.
    /// If you plan to add your own events, you will need to add an enum here, and the corresponding enum
    /// in the player or enemy agent and to also add the translation in the AgentEventTranslator.cs.
    /// I know this is quite a loop but it really has the added advantages of sharing events yet at the same time
    /// not confusing the user with events that are not used depending on the type of agent.
